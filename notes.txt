 
keywords are reserved pre defined words in programming language.
Example : if , else, for , etc

Commands given to machine is called as instruction

Types of Instructions:
Arthmetic, Decision control, Loop control 

Program is a set of instruction executed sequentially or in a sequence.

Need of Data Type:
python is a dynamically typed language ,that is python interpretor assign smartly data type to a variable as per value assigned to it.
Example: x =10, data type of x is int 
y = 10.5 , data type is float
With this data type interpretor allocates memory space for that variable on the RAM




str : Strings 
declared in ' ' , "  " , '''   '''  , """    """


int : integer
It can be both positive and negative
example :  1,2,3,4,5,6 or -9, -234 etc


float : decimal example : 4.8 , 2.5 etc

list :
they are indexable , stores multiple datas, are mutable, declared in []

tuple : 
declared in (), they are immutable, ordered
Exception : var = 1,2,3
	    print(var)
This default stores in tuple



dictionary : {key:value}, declared in key value pair, unique keys, duplicate values

Set : declared in  {} , ordered and unique values

frozen set : {},unordered, unique values
example of how to use it : lst = frozenset({1,2,6,5})


complex : 1j

boolean : True/False


Class:
A class is a user defined data type


Operators:
Arithmetic Operators:

4 + 2 
4 and 2 are operands
+ is the operator


+   sum

-   subtraction

/   div

*   multiplication

// floor division

%   modulus

**  exponent/power 


Assignment Operators:

= 

+=

-=

*=

/=

//=

**=


Comparision Operators:

== 

!=

>

<

>=

<=


Logical Operators:

and   


or


not


Membership Operators:

in


not in


Identity Operators:

is
example: lst1= [1,2,3],    lst2 = [1,2,3]      lst1 is lst2 return True because both are 'list' class

is not


Typecasting:
converting variable from one data type to another

Implicit Typecasting:

converson takes palce by itself:
example: num1 = 4   num2= 4.2

print(num1 + num2)
= 6.4
here the conversion of num1 to float takes place on its own


Explicit Typecasting:
num1 =1
num2 = float(num1)

here we manually convert num1 to float
